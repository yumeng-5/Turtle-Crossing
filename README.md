# Turtle Crossing Game
A classic "Frogger" style game implemented using Python's built-in `turtle` module.

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the Turtle Crossing game. The player controls a turtle starting at the bottom of the screen and must navigate it upwards across multiple lanes of horizontally moving cars. Reaching the top edge ("finish line") safely advances the player to the next level, increasing the speed of the cars. The game ends if the turtle collides with any car.
